## 🧾 Executive Summary

This project simulates the work of an Equity Research Associate by analyzing financial data across technology, FMCG, and real estate sectors. The objective was to evaluate the relationship between leverage (debt) and profitability, with a focus on real estate companies.

### 🔍 Key Findings

- **Highest Leverage**: Real estate companies had the highest average Debt to Equity ratios (~5.7), indicating aggressive use of leverage.
- **Lowest Profitability**: FMCG companies reported the lowest Gross Margins (~0.51).
- **Profitability Distribution**: Tech companies showed the highest and most consistent profitability, followed by real estate.
- **Statistical Insight**: A linear regression model on real estate companies showed a modest but positive relationship between leverage and profitability (R² ≈ 0.25).
- **Trends Over Time**: Tech firms are slightly increasing leverage, while FMCG companies are reducing it.

### 💡 Investment Interpretation

Leverage can contribute to profitability in the real estate sector, but the relationship is not strong enough to be predictive on its own. Investors should also evaluate operational efficiency, capital structure, and sector-specific risks before making allocation decisions.
